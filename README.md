This project presents a comprehensive solution for secure mobile transactions by integrating cutting-edge technologies such as Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)-based signcryption and vein pattern authentication. ECC signcryption ensures confidentiality and non-repudiation of sensitive payment data while streamlining the transaction process. Vein pattern authentication offers a robust security layer by uniquely identifying users based on the intricate vascular patterns in their fingers or palms Leveraging ECC-based signcryption ensures the confidentiality and integrity of payment data, offering robust protection against unauthorized access and data manipulation. Furthermore, the inclusion of vein pattern authentication enhances user identification accuracy, utilizing the unique physiological characteristics of individuals' vein patterns for reliable authentication. The system employs a user login mechanism where vein pattern images are securely stored in a database, facilitating seamless and efficient authentication during transactions. This protocol, integrating encryption and digital signatures, ensures the authenticity and integrity of data transmission between wearable devices and IoT systems or payment platforms. Moreover, the incorporation of advanced ECC-based signcryption guarantees secure transactions by encrypting and digitally signing payment data, providing confidentiality and non-repudiation. This integrated system, bolstered by vein pattern recognition and ECC-based signcryption, not only enhances security but also offers a seamless and effortless payment experience through contactless wearables. By fusing cutting-edge technologies, this proposal represents a significant stride towards fortifying the security and efficiency of mobile transactions in the IoT ecosystem. Through rigorous implementation and local hosting, the system demonstrates its practical feasibility and effectiveness in real-world scenarios. This innovative approach not only enhances the security of mobile transactions but also streamlines the user experience, providing a seamless and convenient payment solution. By integrating advanced cryptographic techniques with biometric authentication, the system offers a comprehensive defense against cyber threats, ensuring user trust and confidence in digital payment systems. This project contributes to the advancement of secure mobile transactions, paving the way for future developments in the field of secure digital transactions and reinforcing the importance of robust security measures in the era of ubiquitous mobile connectivity.
